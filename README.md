# challenge-11-note-taker-mm
After alot of trial and error i present the note taker challenge. this one really was just that to be a challenge. But after some good time spent on it
the application will finally allow you to write and save new notes to the application webpage and will also store the previous notes in the db.json file. 

the application can be initiated via a npm start and is connected to a localhost:3001. please enjoy my note taker application. 

Below I have added the Acceptance Criteria
